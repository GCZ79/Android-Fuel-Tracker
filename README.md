# Android-Fuel-Tracker
Mobile app to help users record and monitor their vehicle's fuel usage

## Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

### The goal of this project was to design and develop a functional mobile application that follows mobile development best practices while prioritizing user-centered design. The app was created to address a practical user need: tracking fuel usage and efficiency over time in a simple, intuitive way. Users are able to create an account, configure personal preferences such as currency, preferred fuel brands, and MPG alert thresholds, and then log fuel refills or import historical data via CSV. The overall requirement was not only to build a working app, but to demonstrate thoughtful planning, usability, and maintainable code.

## What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

### The app has been designed to offer a seamless user experience, and all the pages and various elements have been built with this in mind. All users are initially required to register a username and password to enable session persistence and data saving. From the "Login/Registration" page, first-time users are redirected to the "Preferences" page, where they can pick their favorite gas station brands, set their currency, and decide whether to activate SMS alerts for MPG values below or above a user-defined threshold. To reduce the needed steps to get to the core of the app, any subsequent login will redirect returning users straight to the "Fuel Refill" page, where they can quickly save the data of their fuel refill sessions. A "Database" page allows them to Create, Read, Update, and Delete their records, and even to upload historical refill data in CSV format. Finally, a "Statistics" page provides insights into the collected data, organizing and showing it with charts and numerical values. To optimize the available screen space, the various pages can be navigated through the small menu button in the top-right corner. While minimal, the menu button offers a simple and effective navigation.
I believe that all the above decisions show clearly how user experience was central in the design of the app, and that the simple yet effective interface should allow any user a smooth and error-free experience.
